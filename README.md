# ontherocks


## Desciption
This goal of this project was to create a website that is easy to navigate and user friendly, that allows the user to search for a drink with it's ingredients by category of liquor, name of ingredient, or alphabetically. When the user clicks on the drink of their choice, a modal pops up with information about the drink and how to make it and a picture. Also, there is an "Ice Breaker" button that serves as a conversation starter. A user can click the button and a randomly generated conversation topic is displayed.
